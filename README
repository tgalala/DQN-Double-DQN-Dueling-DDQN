Q Learning Applications: Basic and Advanced Applications Using OpenAI Environments
__________________________________________________________________________________


This work presenst the methods and tools used to build and apply Q-learning and DQN algorithms (and their variations) 
in two separate OpenAI Gym environments (Taxi v_3, Lunar_Lander v_2) to demonstrate their effectiveness as model 
free methods for training goal driven agents. The tasks are navigation based and episodic, but include both discrete 
and continuous environments. We seek to identify and investigate the most important methods and parameters for improving
performance. We achieved our best results with Dueling Double DQN by solving the lunar landing environment in 298 episodes, 
surpassing our expectations.
